# cam-stream

Live video streaming over TCP and UDP with h264 encoding for NVidia Accelerated Gstreamer.

The host is always a NVidia L4T device with Accelerated Gstreamer. The scripts for receivers work with regular gstreamer plugins. Make sure to have gst plugins including `libav` installed on the receiver.

Manual of each script can be printed by launching it.

Created on NVidia Jetson Nano.
